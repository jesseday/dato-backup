# DatoCMS export scripts

These scripts are to work with exporting content and
structure from DatoCMS.  The intention is that this
content and structure could then be transformed as
needed if moving to a different host.

## Usage

* Install dependencies: `npm i`
* Export all content: `npm run export:content`
* Export the CMS model structure: `npm run export:structure`
